<title>Description</title>

<para>
<command>axfr-get</command> is a UCSPI-TCP/UCSPI-SSL client program that copies DNS data from a content DNS server across the network, using the old-style "zone transfer" mechanism.
It sends a "zone transfer" request over the network to the server, reads the results back, and saves them in a database source file, the input that is compiled by <citerefentry><refentrytitle>tinydns-data</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
It expects to be run via a program such as <citerefentry><refentrytitle>tcpclient</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> which makes the network connection to the server and sets up UCSPI environment variables.
</para>

<para>
<command>axfr-get</command> performs a zone transfer for domain <replaceable>apex</replaceable> and updates <replaceable>data</replaceable> atomically. 
It writes the results to <replaceable>tmp</replaceable> and renames that replacement into place as <replaceable>data</replaceable> when it has completed the "zone transfer", completely and successfully built the data file, and written it to disc.
<replaceable>tmp</replaceable> and <replaceable>data</replaceable> thus must be on the same filesystem. 
</para>

<para>
<command>axfr-get</command> writes the zone serial number as a comment at the top of the data file.
It skips the zone transfer, leaving <replaceable>data</replaceable> alone, if <replaceable>data</replaceable> already exists, <replaceable>data</replaceable> has a serial number matching the zone serial number, and both serial numbers are nonzero. 
</para>

<para>
Zone transfers often include duplicate records. 
To eliminate them, you should feed the <command>axfr-get</command> results through <command>sort</command> <arg choice='plain'>-u</arg> before compiling them. 
</para>

<para>
<command>axfr-get</command> discards all records not at or beneath the domain <replaceable>apex</replaceable>. 
It accepts records for domain names in child zones, i.e. for domain names beneath delegation points, but since those delegation points are there <citerefentry><refentrytitle>tinydns</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> will not report those records except as glue. 
If you plan to merge the <command>axfr-get</command> results for a domain and a child of the same domain, creating a single database source file encompassing both zones, make sure to eliminate records in the first output that are within the child zone. 
</para>

<para>
<command>axfr-get</command> will accept arbitrarily large zone transfers.
To limit the maximum file size to (for example) 1 megabyte, run <command>axfr-get</command> under <command>softlimit</command> <arg choice='plain'>-f</arg> <arg choice='plain'>1048576</arg>. 
</para>

<title>Compatibility</title>

<para>
<command>axfr-get</command> handles BIND's RFC-1034-violating multiple-answers zone-transfer format. 
</para>

<para>
There are some side effects of the behaviour of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>tinydns</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> (q.v.) that mean that what is published from a "zone transfer" replica will not appear as in the original:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
BIND's handling of wildcards such as <filename>*.example</filename> is not precisely simulated. 
Under BIND, records for <filename>*.example</filename> do not apply to <filename>y.example</filename> or <filename>anything.y.example</filename> if there is a normal record for <filename>x.y.example</filename>. 
With <citerefentry><refentrytitle>tinydns</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>, the wildcard records apply to <filename>y.example</filename> and <filename>anything.y.example</filename> except <filename>x.y.example</filename>. 
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
BIND's handling of multiple IP addresses for a single name are not precisely simulated if there are more than 8 of them.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The "zone transfer" mechanism is incapable of carrying all of the information that can be contained in a database source file.
Do not use it to replicate from one <citerefentry><refentrytitle>axfrdns</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> server to another.
Use an ordinary remote file copying program such as <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rsync</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
